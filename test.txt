Today was Sunday and I was very happy!In the morning，
I stayed at home to do my$ homework and watch TV。In the afternoon，
I went to a park with my best friends。There were many flowers，
@and some birds were singing songs。We played games and talked about our dreams。
I went to a shop with my families。
 At last，we went home for din%%%ner。
To explore strange new worlds,
To seek out new life and new civilizations
